# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching

This week was long and hard. I watched all the videos and learnt a lot about data modelling in dynamodb, implementing a query using single table design and also provisioning tables with provisioned capacity. I created the schema-load page and executed it. Modified a lot of the existing files to fit our dynamodb purpose. Some modifications went smoothly and others did not and gave me different results which i had to try and debug to fix them. I also watched Ashish's video and learnt about DAX and security best practices for dynamodb.

CHALLENGES
         Following the videos instructions and making the necessary changes in my application threw up a lot of errors. Some i was able to debug but others i couldn't as at now. My app was blank at some point because the MessageGroupNewPage.js was not loading but i was able to debug that.
          The major challenge this week was my that after typing messages, it could not be displayed on the screen as shown in the video. I am currently still working on trying to debug it. I sure i made an error somewhere but confident i will be able to debug it at some point. 

Looking forward to next week.

In details, i use built the schema-load page and executed the file.
