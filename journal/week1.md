# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
This week was all about learning how to use Docker. I started by creating a dockerfile and copied the instructions into it, i then ran the file and open the ports making them public but i got a 404 error. However, when i append to the URL /api/activities/home i got some json data which means it's working.
         I ran npm install for both Frontend and Backend and then created the docker-compose.yml file and added some content into it. After that i used docker-compose to launch the containers and opened the ports so i could see the application on my browser.
       I added a notification endpoint using OpenApi, after which i added a a page for notifications using React in the application frontend. After installing aws cli, i was able to use it and configure dynamodb and same with postgres.
