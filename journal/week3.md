# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

This week was all about decentralised authentication using amazon cognito and amplify. I started by watching the first live video and was able to install and save aws amplify.
I continued by going into the console and creating a user pool with aws cognito name cruddur-user-pool.![2023-03-07 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75304701/223380323-f920109b-ec57-4ade-a22c-39fabe213a17.png)
Then i implemented some changes in the code's dockoer-compose file, app.js, SigninPage.js, HomeFeed.js and others.
I also created a user called bonise in my cognito user pool![2023-03-07 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75304701/223380969-7c2b611d-250e-47f7-9dd2-38ef14d989c2.png)
